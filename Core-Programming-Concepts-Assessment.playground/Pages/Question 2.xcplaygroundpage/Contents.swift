        * I know the difference between a constant and a variable and when it is appropriate to use each.

 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**

// Answer question 2 below

let NameOfBook = "Computer Science"
let AuthorName = "Ayana"
let Yearpublushed = 2018
print ("The name of the book, the authorname and the yearpublushed never change, so it is constant")


var NumberOfCopiesSold = 9000
var Sellingprice = 20
print ("The number of copies sold and sellingprise would be change, so it is variable")
