 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**

// Answer question 2 below

var NameOfBook : Int
var Authorname : Int
var Yearpublushed : Int
print ("The name of the book, the authorname and the yearpublushed never change, so it is constant")


let NumberOfCopiesSold : Int
let Sellingprice : Int
print ("The number of copies sold and sellingprise would be change, so it is variable")
